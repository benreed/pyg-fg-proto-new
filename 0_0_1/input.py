	Class to encompass a Pygame input event
	(so as to retain type and key members)
	with a timestamp in frames since last input
	event recorded.
	
	(The intention is not just to timestamp,
	but also remember event type and event 
	key. That way the logical relationship
	between keyup/keydown for the same key
	is preserved even if the two events are
	separated in time by events for different
	keys.)
